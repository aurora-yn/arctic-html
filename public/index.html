        <h2>Animals endangered in the Arctic</h2>
        <p class="main-para">
          Endangered Arctic Species of all the species that have ever lived, 95% are now extinct. Extinction has been a natural process for millions of years, so why all the concern? 
          The issue is not that extinction occurs, but the rate at which it is happening. More importantly, the increased rate of extinction is a direct result of human interference and ignorance. 
          All too often we exploit the land and its inhabitants without a thought as to the consequences of our actions. 
          Even the smallest creature plays a pivotal role in ecosystem equilibrium.
          The Arctic's ecosystem is particularly vulnerable to the slightest of alterations, which can have dramatic, and sometimes catastrophic, results.

        <h2>People living in the Arctic</h2>
        <p class="main-para">
            Arctic indigenous peoples are acutely aware of these growing tensions. 
            They’ve lived off the land and hunted animals for food, clothing, and other essential uses for generations. 
            Such a way of life is threatened almost daily by climate extremes.
            The Arctic Council reports that roughly 400,000 indigenous people live throughout the Arctic. They speak over 40 languages, some of which have few remaining speakers. 
            Still, estimating numbers of Indigenous people in the Arctic is difficult. Not everybody collects the numbers, and different countries define “indigenous” differently.

        <h2>Threats to the Arctic</h2>
        <p class="main-para">CLIMATE CHANGE</p>
        <p class="main-para">The release of greenhouse gasses from the burning of fossil fuels and other sources is causing temperatures in the Arctic to warm at twice the rate of the rest of the world, resulting in lower levels of sea ice, melting permafrost and rising sea levels all over the world. The decrease in volume and extent of Arctic sea ice has serious implications for marine mammals that depend on the ice for their survival, such as ringed seals and polar bears. </p>
